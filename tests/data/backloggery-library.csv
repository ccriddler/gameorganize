20966877,"Celeste Classic","Game Boy Advance",,Completed,Normal,Digital,Own,"A tiny, super satisfying platforming challenge. The controls feel tight and responsive, great visuals and music.

My first time climbing the 30 stages took me about 1 hour, with hundreds of deaths.

I kept coming back to replay it, the RA challenges were a good motivator. Looking at some of the challenges (specifically the deathless and speedrun ones), I thought to myself ""I'm never getting that"".

Fast forward a couple weeks, and I'm breezing through the game like it was nothing. It wasn't long before those achievements which once seemed impossible popped up on my screen.

This game has a great difficulty curve, and is very fun to master. It's a benchmark I compare other GBA titles to.",,"2023-07-09 18:22:57"
